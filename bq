2  工作中有没有犯过什么错误，从中学到了什么？(mobS)
The biggest mistake you made and what did you learn from it?  (earn trust, customer obsession)

    The biggest mistake I’ve made happened when I took on and led a project for the first time. 
    I got a requirement from the client about updating parts of a certain workflow. 
    So I documented the requirements, worked on them with the team, and released the update to the demo system on time, 
    however, the client tried and didn’t like it.
    We diagnosed the feedback and system immediately, It turned out that we paid a lot of attention on the changes 
    the client requested us to do, but didn’t do much evaluation on other features that are impacted by the change.
    I apologized to the client immediately and asked if we could have an extended deliver date. 
    Luckily the client agreed and also showed understanding. Then I called a meeting with all the team members, talked about the feedback, 
    then we walked through the whole workflow step by step together, evaluated all the possible operations that user might take 
    on each step and then tailored the change we were gonna make accordingly. 
    Throughout this process, the team members understood what happened, why the client was not happy, 
    and they also brought up a lot of good opinions. 
    Instead of just telling the team to make changes again, I earned their trust by sharing the feedback with them 
    and working out a solution together.
    We then released a tentative version to the demo system before the deadline, walked through it with the client and 
    collected feedback provided. 
    Finally, we delivered the update to the production successfully, our client was very happy and used it every day without any trouble yet.
